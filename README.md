# 🧠 | Ensemble Methods for Model Robustness

This project explores advanced ensemble learning strategies to enhance classification accuracy and generalization. Models are trained, tuned, and evaluated on structured datasets using multiple ensemble paradigms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply and compare ensemble methods: **Bagging**, **Boosting**, **Stacking**, and **Voting**.
- Improve upon single model baselines by combining multiple learners.
- Visualize and analyze improvements in metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## 🧪 Methods Explored

- **Random Forests**: Averaging multiple decision trees to reduce variance.  
- **AdaBoost / Gradient Boosting**: Focused training on hard samples using weak learners.  
- **Stacking**: Layered model architecture where base model outputs are used as features for a meta-learner.  
- **Voting Classifier**: Aggregation of diverse models using hard and soft voting.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python · scikit-learn  
- XGBoost / LightGBM (optional)  
- Matplotlib · Seaborn for visualization  

## 📊 Results

- Ensemble methods outperformed individual models across all metrics.  
- **Stacked models** showed highest test accuracy and generalization.  
- ROC and precision-recall curves validated performance improvement.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- Ensembling reduces model variance and boosts performance on imbalanced or noisy data.  
- Proper tuning and cross-validation are essential to prevent overfitting in boosted models.  
- Stacking adds depth to traditional ensembles and often yields the best results when managed well.
